* **Cross-Lingual Automated Essay Scoring** | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sharonmordechai/nlp-final-project-essay-scoring/tree/master).

    Enhancing Hebrew Language Performance via Transfer Learning of an English Language Model. \
    This project presents a cross-lingual automated essay scoring system that enhances the performance of Hebrew language essays using transfer learning from an English language model.

    The [code](https://github.com/sharonmordechai/nlp-final-project-essay-scoring/blob/master/notebook/NLP_Final_Project_Essay_Scoring.ipynb) demonstrates the implementation of transfer learning techniques to fine-tune a pre-trained English language model, creating an accurate and robust scoring model for Hebrew essays.

* **Malware Families Classification**

    Collaborated with ReasonLabs at IronSource to design and implement a robust multi-class classification model for Malware Family identification, focusing on static malware features and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) runtime behaviors. Analyzed a dataset of over 100 million records, performing extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering. Evaluated and optimized multiple machine learning and neural network models to enhance detection accuracy and insights into malware behavior, contributing valuable findings to cybersecurity research and threat intelligence efforts.

## Projects

* **AI Assistant with Vector Store & Database Integration**

    Developed a versatile AI Assistant leveraging OpenAI's GPT models for dynamic, conversational interactions. Built with Langchain to handle advanced agent management, memory, and tool creation, the assistant supports a streamlined, user-friendly experience through a Streamlit interface.

    The assistant features two key capabilities:

    - Vector Store Integration: Uses FAISS to provide efficient document search, enabling users to upload and search through PDFs, DOCX, and TXT files for relevant content retrieval.
    - Database Integration: Expands functionality by allowing CSV file uploads, enabling the assistant to answer data-specific questions through Langchain’s robust data-processing capabilities.

* **Recommendation Systems - Bloom Embeddings**

    Recommendation algorithms tend to have large input and output dimensionalities that dominate their overall size. This makes them difficult to train, due to the limited memory of graphical processing units, and difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited hardware. To address these difficulties, I propose Bloom embeddings, a compression technique that can be applied to the input and output of neural network models dealing with sparse high-dimensional binary-coded instances.

* **Sudoku Solver using Computer Vision Techniques**

    This project explores the application of computer vision techniques to solve a Sudoku puzzle using OpenCV and augmented reality principles. The objective is to develop a system that takes an image containing a Sudoku board as input and produces an output image with the puzzle’s solution. By leveraging image processing and pattern recognition, the project aims to automate the solution process, showcasing the power of computer vision in real-world problem-solving.

* **Highway Environment - Reinforcement Learning**

    Highway is a collection of environments for autonomous driving and tactical decision-making tasks. The goal is to help the user car overtake the bot cars on its own in a roadway environment.

    I trained the user car with the help of deep reinforcement learning (DQN, DDQN, and Actor-Critic algorithms), the reward function will penalize the user car every time it slows down, every time it crashes into a bot car, and if there are any bot cars in front of it. In the following environments, I used the raw pixels as our state space, therefore, it will allow us to train CNN Neural Networks.
